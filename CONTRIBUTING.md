# Contribution Guidelines

## Creating your own awesome freelance list

To create your own list, you can copy start from the [template](TEMPLATE.md) and fill it as you need.
You can alter the presentation if you like, but try to do that only if you **really** need it.

### Campus list

The first item on the list will always be a list of all **awesome-42-freelance-`#CAMPUS`** github repositories.
Format:

```markdown
## Awesome 42 Freelance lists by Campus

- [42paris](https://github.com/CamilleBC/awesome-42-freelance-42paris)

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-\* list guidelines.
